# Testing NavCoin Products

## Overview

{{< big_text >}}
Testing is a critical part of open source software - particularly in crypto where there is a financial incentive for people to try attack the network. Testing can help identify any bugs, and improve the overall user experience. And you don’t have to be a developer to help test NavCoin! Anyone can download the latest ‘release candidate wallet’ and give their feedback via GitHub.

  text="Testing shouldn’t sound scary at all, if you are not into the programming space, you can do very well in testing as a user just the same! There are lots of digital products and software built by the active NavCoin community, tell us how you feel about using a certain product, what may have confused you and what would you suggest to improve!"
